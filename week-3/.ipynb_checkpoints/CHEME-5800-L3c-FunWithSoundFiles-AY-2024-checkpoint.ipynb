    "# Example: Let's Build and Test a Library of `WAV` sound files\n",
    "In `lab-3b`, we explored the [Bubble Sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) on an array of `Int64` values. An exciting part of the lab was when we `played` the sorting operation, i.e., we played a tone corresponding to each number in the array. Thus, we could hear the difference between a sorted array and a random one. In this example, let's take a deeper dive into how we generated the tones and how we mapped these tones to `Int64` values.
