    "# Example: Properties of Markov Models and Stationary Distributions\n",
    "The objective of this example is to familiarize students with Markov models and components of Markov models, in particular the transition matrix $\\mathbf{P}$, computing the stationary distribution $\\pi$, and finally sampling the stationary distribution using categorical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "A discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of random variables $X_{1},\\dotsc,X_{n}$ with \n",
    "the [Markov property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property), \n",
    "i.e., the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present and not past states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "P(X_{n+1} = x | X_{1}=x_{1}, \\dots, X_{n}=x_{n}) = P(X_{n+1} = x | X_{n}=y)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For finite state spaces $\\mathcal{S}$, the probability of moving from the state(s) $i\\rightarrow{j}$ in the next step, \n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ has interesting properties: \n",
    "* First, the rows of transition matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ sum to unity, i.e., each row encodes the probability of all possible outcomes. \n",
    "Thus, it must sum to one.\n",
    "* Second, if the transition matrix  $\\mathbf{P}$ is invariant, $p_{ij}$ doesn't change as $n\\rightarrow{n+1}~\\forall{n}$."
